###Jon

I've created the first commit through Eclipse using EGit.

##Style

I suggest we use Camel Casing for consistency in this project. Look it up for more information, but the basics are that variables are lower case and method/interface names are upper case for the first letter:

'''java
public int variable;
public int otherVariable;

public void MethodName(){

}
'''

and so on.
