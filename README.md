###Jon

I've created the first commit through Eclipse using EGit. The basic workflow after configuration is:
*Pull from repository
*Do work
*Commit and push changes

##Style

I suggest we use Pascal Casing for consistency in this project. Look it up for more information, 
but the basics are that variables are lower case and method/interface names are upper case for
the first letter:

```java
public int variable;
public int otherVariable;

/**
 * Javadoc comment
 */
public void MethodName(){
	// Comment
}
```

and so on.
