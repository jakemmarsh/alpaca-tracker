From the teacher:
This is the current version of the PracaTraca Interface, including a skeleton implementation. 
I am still creating a Factory that will build instances of these sensor classes.  You should
plan to implement your own version of these sensor classes to use in your unit tests so you 
can hard-wire data in the getter methods that you can test with.  Then the Factory I create 
will be able to return instances of your sensor test data classes as well as return instances 
of the real data classes and eventually, even the emulated data classes the graduate students 
will build.
