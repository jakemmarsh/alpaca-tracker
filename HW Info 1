Homework: Develop UML Model for Project
=============================================
* Domain Model (UML Class Diagram) 

* User Interface Model (User Interface Screens Mockup) 

* Get into VersionOne and use Training Videos to learn the basics

* In VersionOne, create 10-15 User Stories/Epics in the form 
As a <ROLE>, I need to <GOAL>, so that <REASON>, Done When_______.  Remember, an epic is bigger 
than you can get done in one iteration.  Your iterations are one week long.  So if the work is 
more than a week, you need to break it down into a story.

* Size your stories using story points (use Fibonacci numbers: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21) and for 1 week, 
lets say a story is 5 or less. 

* Prioritize your stories, using drag and drop on the product planning page

* Pick one of your stories, and schedule it into a sprint from the Sprint  Planning Page add your 
user story to your first Sprint (drag and drop).  From the Detailed Planning sub-page, create 
development tasks under this story.  Each task is no more than 8 hours for the Detailed Estimate. 
Put a personâ€™s name on the task and an estimate in hours for the task to be done.

* Implement your story and mark your tasks as inProgress when started and Done when finished. Do 
this on the Detailed Tracking page as you finish them.
